## Description

We imagined a well-organized and user-friendly but also modern website together.<br>
After this procedure, I started to work on the website front-end part. I built out every page and every panel for faster and more continuous work to step to the next level
with the back-end.<br>
After everything was in their space I finally started to work on
the database and the website’s communication together.<br>
For this project the **PHP** and **MySQL** were unmissable. Of course, besides these, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, **SASS**, **Bootstrap**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery** to create an E-commerce website.
